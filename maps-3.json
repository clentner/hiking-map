            "description": "What a way to bag the 4 most maligned 4000 footers!\n\nDay 1, 18 miles:\nBagged Tom, Field, and Willey in sporadic rain without too much trouble. Lucked out and got a great view from Willey. The steep descent was slow going, especially with rungs out on some of the ladders. Then began the looong journey over mostly flat terrain to the tent site. Thoreau Falls was beautiful, and the Wilderness Trail was truly remote - we didn't see a single soul after we left the AT until we got all the way to the tent site.\n\nMy highlight was crossing the East Pemigewasset at the site of the Molly Monuments. Stream flow at the USGS Lincoln monitoring location was about 344 ft^3/s and this wasn't a dry crossing but wasn't bad. We made camp well after dark, ate some Skurka pesto noodles, and crashed.\n\nDay 2, 15 miles:\nWoke up at 5:30am, broke camp, and crossed the Pemigewasset at the Lincoln Tentsite location. Stream flow about 334 ft^3/s and we had a hard time finding a good spot to cross. At 5'10 I was up to my thighs and one of us went up to her waist. Thankfully everyone made it safely! Give up on dry feet if you attempt this hike. All of us did by the end and started to enjoy the cooling feeling of fresh water soaking our socks.\n\nThe Black Pond Bushwhack is in great condition, better than some of the official Appalachian Trail by Ethan Pond. Saw a couple tents off it as well. Several more wet-feet river crossings followed, but the Owl's Head Slide was dry! Great views of the east face of Lincoln and Lafayette. The ascent gets easier as you go, the weather was nice, and we were in good spirits by the time we stopped for lunch at the true summit. The Brutus Bushwhack was easy to find, easy to follow, and probably easier on our knees, but other hikers reported that the descent down the slide was surprisingly not bad. Then a long fast backtrack, and a blissfully easy 2 miles on a rail trail culminated in an actual, still existing, not closed bridge!\n\nWhat a weekend. 44/48!",

Saw a few stock-looking Subarus - hats off. We took a 4runner and had a fine bumpy ride.\n\nSaw several goats and marmots!\n\n14k elevation was pretty tough for us even after sleeping at 9k for 3 nights, but we made it!",
